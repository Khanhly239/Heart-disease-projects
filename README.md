# Heart-disease-projects
This repository contains two key implementations related to cardiovascular health:

# 1. Heartbeat Sounds Classification using CNN

- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model for classifying heartbeat sounds into normal and abnormal categories.
- Utilizes spectrogram transformations of heartbeat audio signals for robust feature extraction.
- Dataset: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kinguistics/heartbeat-sounds/data)
- Implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras, Librosa for audio processing, and Matplotlib for visualization.

# 2. Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

- Predicting the risk of heart failure using traditional machine learning techniques.
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Models implemented: XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine
- Two approaches for predicting heart failure outcomes: a Statistical Model and a Domain Information Model
- Performance evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
# Features
✅ Preprocessing and augmentation of heartbeat sounds
✅ CNN-based feature extraction and classification
✅ ML-based predictive analytics for heart failure risk
✅ Visualization of results and model performance
